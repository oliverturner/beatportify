### What it does
- ü•∞  Links the music you like on Spotify to buy on Beatport and Bandcamp
- üéß  Shows you each track's musical key so you can see how DJ mixes are structured
- üîç  Surfaces related tracks and artists 

### How it works
Portify uses the amazing [Architect](https://arc.codes) framework to easily shape data from Spotify's API and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to surface it.

I built it as a learning exercise and because it was a product that I needed. Mad respect to [Henry Desroches](https://twitter.com/xdesro) and [Tom Duncalf](https://twitter.com/tomduncalf) for their prior art and inspiration:

This is a very early sneak peek... there's much more to come! üòÄ

## TO DO:

### UX
- [ ] User preferences: allow toggling musical notation
- [x] Link to album page from tracks
- [x] Load tracks + audio for albums
- [x] Fix missing playlists at boot
- [ ] Preload top 100 playlists
- [ ] Underline artist links
- [x] Truncate long titles in mobile headers
- [ ] TrackList: Offer compact views of items
- [ ] TrackList: Make sortable via derived store
- [ ] Paging: Make page limits configurable
- [ ] Paging: Scroll-to-load on paged content
- [x] Album: Use CSS counter to display track numbers against names AND/OR create `albumIndex`?
- [x] Album: Don't repeat cover image per track
- [ ] Page transitions

#### Stretch
- [ ] Use Spotify Connect to highlight playing track

### Tech debt
- [ ] Remove `/track/:id` endpoint
- [ ] Relax `processTrack` requirements: Pick<{...required}>

### DX        
- [ ] Work out how to attach a debug session to Arc endpoints
- [ ] Switch to Snowpack
- [ ] Use query params to drive paging?

### Perf:
- [x] Create a `use:onload` action for fading in lazy-loaded images
- [ ] Investigate `content-visibility`
